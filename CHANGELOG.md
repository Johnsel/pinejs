## v0.4.0

* __model is no longer sent on GET requests to a resource.
* `ConfigLoader.loadNodeConfig` has been removed (use `ConfigLoader.loadApplicationConfig` instead)

## v0.3.9

* SQL queries are only logged when debugging
* Dev model .log output is now suppressed
* TRANSACTION_TIMEOUT_MS environment variable can be used again

## v0.3.8

* PlatformSessionStore is now exported from module build

	* Configure your own express application
	* Use the platform as a library, rather than having your app loaded as custom code

* Added support for `and`/`or` within SBVR rules.
* Fix bower requirejs to v2.1.9 as later versions break the platform client-side (due to shim dependencies not working correctly)

## v0.3.6

## v0.3.5

* Custom code modules no longer have to define a setup() method

* Improved performance of SQL queries when we do not need to bind any default values.
* Improve performance of creating a transaction.
* Improve performance of all PostgreSQL queries and any SQL queries that bind default values.
* Improve the performance of PostgreSQL queries when there are no binds in the SQL.

## v0.3.0

* Change runURI signature from `(method, uri, body = {}, tx, callback) ->` to `(method, uri, body = {}, tx, req, callback) ->`, where if `req` is an object then it will have its `user` property used for permission checking rather than using the default of full permissions if it's not an object.
* Update sbvr-parser to v0.0.12
	* Fixes an error being logged when trying to get hints for the verb part of a new fact type
	* Fixes rule-like definitions for terms and names
* Fix an issue where api keys that looked like valid user ids were treated as a user id.

## v0.2.29

* Use a SQL hinter for the database import/export tab.
* Improve generic error messages returned for foreign/unique key violations in cases where detailed info cannot be obtained.

## v0.2.28

* Add support for a TRANSACTION_TIMEOUT_MS env var, that specifies how long before a transaction is automatically closed (via a rollback).
* Use error codes to detect the error type for postgresql, this makes the checking much more resilient.
* Updated bluebird to ~1.2.4

## v0.2.27

* sbvrUtils.executeModel and sbvrUtils.executeModels now expect a model object, rather than vocabulary name/sbvr text.
* Improved constraint failure checks for WebSQL.
* 500 errors are now used correctly, rather than incorrect 50x variants.
* PUT requests are now correctly rolled back on a rule violation
